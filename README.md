Safely open apps on your Mac. After you have tried to open the app, follow these steps:
1. Open System Settings.
2. Click Privacy & Security, scroll down, and click the Open Anyway button to confirm your intent to open or install the app.
3. The warning prompt reappears and, if you're absolutely sure that you want to open the app anyway, you can click Open.
